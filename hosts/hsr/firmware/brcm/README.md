# FIrmware

This is, technically, not redistributable because of the license on the firmware.

Personally, I think that's kinda lame, but I also like not getting sued.

There are people who host copies of this firmware on GitHub; go find them.

This host uses brcmfmac4364b3-pcie.apple,bali.txcap\_blob - others may differ.
